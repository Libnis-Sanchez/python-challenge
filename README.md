Module 3 Challenge
For the PyBank folder I used Visual Studio to write my code. I started by importing the csv file so that the data could be used. I then made variables and created lists to store the data. After that, I opened the csv file in “read” mode. Since there was a header, I went ahead and skipped that and created a for loop. In the for loop I coded to get the count for the total number of months, appended the respective rows, and calculated the needed information. I found the max and min change in profits with the corresponding dates the changes were observed. Finally I printed in the terminal to get the desired information and created a text file. For the text file, I opened it in “write” mode as “text” to get the desired information. For the PyPoll folder I did the same thing except I made a couple of for loops, one for the total number of votes and another for the unique candidate names.
